# Shifted Dimensions

Entry to the js13kGames 2017 gamejam/competition

## How To Play

You are in a weightless universe and have lost your special stones that give you energy!
You must find them all before your remaining energy is drained.

The stones are however invisible to the normal eye and scattered all around you.
To make them visible, you can activate your magic light by keeping the trigger pressed.

Point the light onto a stone and keep the it activated  to pull a lost stone closer to you.

You can also hear stones that are close to you.

But be careful! Activating the magic light will drain your energy!

Have fun! :)
